When the sphincter becomes incompetent or doesn’t close properly, the acidic contents of the stomach leak into the esophagus. This condition is known as reflux and can irritate and damage the inner lining of the esophagus leading to gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux disease. Population-based studies have shown that up to 15% of individuals have the symptoms of reflux at least once a week and 7% have symptoms daily.', 'http://niroginepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Acid-Reflux-Disease-1.png', '<div><ul><p>When we eat food, it travels through the mouth to the food pipe (esophagus) and then to the stomach.

It can bleed and cause pain during swallowing. </span></li><li><span>Development of Barrett’s esophagus which increases the risk of cancer and needs endoscopy to monitor the progression of the disease.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is GERD diagnosed?</code><p>GERD is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms reported by the patients. Health Care Providers may consider additional diagnostics when the symptoms get complicated or persist for a long time, or there is no response to therapy. In such cases, an endoscopy may be performed which helps to visualize the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine by inserting a small camera that down the throat. Esophageal manometry is another test which is used to measure the pressure inside the lower part of the esophagus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is GERD treated?</code><p>The goal of the treatment is to provide relief from symptoms and heal erosive lesions and complications if any. Mild symptoms can be managed by weight reduction, sleeping with the head of the bed elevated by about 4-6 inches and elimination of the factors that increase stomach pressure. Patients should not smoke and should avoid consuming fatty foods, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, mint, orange juice and certain medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, anticholinergic agents, calcium channel blockers and smooth muscle relaxants. You should avoid eating heavy meals and consuming a lot of liquids with meals. Preferred painkillers for those suffering from GERD are acetaminophen and paracetamol.</p><p>For treating mild cases of acid reflux disease, health care providers may use drugs like cimetidine and ranitidine. These drugs help to reduce the acid secretion in the stomach. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are useful in symptom relief and are commonly used in combination with over the counter antacids syrups. Patients are recommended to take these drugs 15-30 minutes before daily meals. Healthcare providers may recommend anti-reflux surgery for those patients with persistent symptoms even after changes in lifestyle and medicines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>'),

When kidney function declines slowly over a period it is called <em>chronic kidney disease</em> (failure). Acute kidney failure develops mainly in very sick hospitalised patients.</p><p>If you are healthy and young, acute kidney failure can resolve completely by itself, or you may develop a chronic kidney disease. The risk of developing a chronic kidney disease goes up with age and presence of other chronic medical conditions.

When these antibodies combine with the allergen, an allergic reaction is produced which can manifest as a skin rash to life threatening cardiovascular collapse.   Common allergens are pollens, grass, house mites, animal danders, molds, latex, certain food (peanut, lactose in the milk) etc. Both the genetic makeup of the person and environmental factors are responsible for triggering the allergic reaction. People who suffer from allergies are usually sensitive to more than one allergens.', 'http://niroginepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Allergy.png', '<div><ul><p>Allergy is a conditions where your body abnormally reacts to foreign substances that normally should notproduce any reaction.

People who suffer from allergies are usuallysensitive to more than one allergens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms </code><p>Allergy manifests as different symptoms based on the organs ( nose, throat, lungs, sinuses, ear, skin andgastrointestinal tract) involved. Signs and Symptoms range from mild symptoms of itchiness, rash, runny nosewatery/red eyes to a life threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Moderately severe symptoms includeswelling of airway causing breathing difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Types of Allergic Diseases</code><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic Rhinitis</code><p>Allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, mostly occurs during spring and fall due to airborne pollens. It isalso called seasonal rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis can occur in response to allergens that are presentthroughout the year like animal dander, proteins derived from cockroaches, mold spores and dust. This iscalled perennial allergic rhinitis. Symptoms include sneezing, stuffy or running nose, obstruction of thenasal passage, itching in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, pharynx and roof of the mouth. In susceptiblepeople, symptoms generally appear before the fourth decade of life and tend to diminish gradually withaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Urticaria</code><p>Also known as hives, urticaria is characterized by red bumps on the skin of varying sizes that occur ingroups. These involve the upper part of the skin and may be associated with swelling and itching. Urticariais often associated with swelling. Atopic dermatitis or eczema is another skin manifestation of allergy withsymptoms like itching, reddening and peeling of the skin. More than half of the people with atopicdermatitis have been found to develop asthma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic conjunctivitis</code><p>When eye is exposed to specific allergic agents, it shows the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis likeitching, reddening, swelling of the conjunctiva and watering of the eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Asthma</code><p>Allergy plays a significant role in pathogenesis and manifestation of disease. Details discussed elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Food allergy</code><p>Food allergy occurs when the immune system of the body recognizes a particular food protein as an allergen.Even tiny amount of the food is enough to trigger the allergic reaction. Most common type of food items thattrigger allergic reaction are cow’s milk, peanuts, egg protein, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish and tree nuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic Sinusitis</code><p>Sinuses are hollow cavities within the face around our eyes and behind the nose. Allergy can triggerinflammation in these sinuses which produces nasal congestion, cough, fever and thick, dirty nasaldischarge. This condition is known as allergic rhino-sinusitis. People with asthma and allergic rhinitis aremore likely to suffer from sinusitis because of frequent involvement of airways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Anaphylaxis</code><p>Anaphylaxis is a severe form of allergic reaction which is life threatening. It can affect more than one bodypart at the same time. Symptoms include red itchy rash, lightheadedness, difficulty in breathing, tightnessin the throat and chest, anxiety, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. Anaphylactic reaction canmanifest as shock when there is sudden fall in the blood pressure which leads to loss of consciousness.Agents known to cause anaphylaxis are food items, insect bites, wasp sting, latex and various types ofdrugs. Since it is a life threatening condition, anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention whichincludes maintenance of airway, breathing and circulation as first aid and injection of epinephrine astreatment. Urgent hospital admission is required when symptoms of anaphylaxis are seen. If not treated ontime, anaphylactic reactions can also be fatal due to respiratory failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis and Treatment</code><p>A thorough medical history and physical examination is required to identify allergy. Family history ofallergy and history of environmental exposure to allergen is equally important. Allergy skin testing orpatch testing with blood examination is also performed in order to determine the type of allergic agentinvolved.</p><p>Once a specific allergen is identified, you should try to avoid exposure to the offending agents. Drugs suchas antihistamines and decongestants in form of tablets can be prescribed in order to relieve the allergysymptoms. Topical nasal sprays are helpful in treating nasal symptoms. Severe symptoms not controlled byavoidance and medications can be sometimes treated by immunotherapy called “allergy shots”. In thistreatment, doctor gives you a series of injection of the allergen extract under your skin over a long periodof time so that you develop tolerance to the allergen. If you had an anaphylactic reaction before, yourdoctor will ask you to carry an “epi-pen” that contains epinephrine that you can inject under the skin whenyou feel you might be having an anaphylaxis. Although there is no cure for allergy once diagnosed, followingthe advice from the physician and appropriate modification in lifestyle can protect from allergic reactionsin the future.</p></ul></div>'),

You may or may not notice the early subtle signs of difficulty remembering things but your family may notice it.</p><p>Some of the examples of memory impairment and challenges of perception and judgment include:</p><ul><li>Forgetting important dates; asking the same questions again and again; needing to use reminder aids or rely on others to do things you used to take care of yourself.</li><li>Confusion with location, dates, and time</li><li>Putting things in very unusual places and not finding them</li><li>Poor judgement, such as giving a large sum of money to scammers</li><li>Withdrawing from social activities, such as following your favorite sports team or hobby</li><li>Changing mood and personality, such as becoming afraid, confused, depressed, or suspicious</li><li>Perceptual-motor problems: Such as trouble getting out of a chair or setting the table</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>There is no test that can tell you with certainty that you have Alzheimer’s except a microscopic examination of the brain after a person dies. The doctor will make a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on your symptoms and a physical and neuropsychological examination. The doctor may perform other test like blood test, MRI, CT ,EEG and PET scans to rule out other causes of memory loss. The testing of brain activity through EEG is also done as required. Genetic testing are not routinely indicated except for cases with early onset memory loss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Medical treatment can help manage memory loss and other brain function symptoms. Non medical treatments like regular physical exercise, engagement in social and intellectual activities can slow down the progression of the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>Certain lifestyle factors are thought to reduce the risk of getting alzheimer’s disease. Increasing social engagement and participation in intellectually stimulating activities may preserve brain function. Similarly, regular physical exercise specially geared towards cardiovascular health may prevent mental decline. A healthy diet low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables is suggested to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. A mediterranean diet is thought to be of significant value in preventing Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>'),

The pain initially starts around navel and gets localised to the right side of the lower abdomen. The pain becomes severe while coughing or during sudden movements and relieved by knee flexion to the chest while.

While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children. The goal of treatment is to maximise your child’s ability to function by reducing ASD symptoms and supporting development and learning. Every child with autism is unique so the treatment plan is individualized to meet specific needs. The mainstay of treatment therapies are behavioural and communication therapies, education therapies, family therapies and medications to alleviate symptoms like anxiety, depression or behavioural problems. </span></p><p><span>The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that parents themselves can give psychosocial and behavioral treatments to the child with autism. If your child has autism spectrum disorder, you can help improve your child’s language and social skills so that your child can adjust to the needs of his daily life.

It appears on the fourth day of fever and lasts for 4-7 days. &nbsp;It takes 6-12 days for a child to develop symptoms after getting exposed to the virus. But the child may transmit the virus to others &nbsp;even before (1-2 days) the onset of symptoms and 3-4 days after development of rashes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Chicken pox:</b><span> The rash starts as a red flat rash that soon become raised and later becomes fluid filled that ruptures and forms crusts before healing completely. Lesions at different stage are seen as new rashes continue to form for several days. It start on the trunk and spreads to limbs. &nbsp;Appears on the first day of fever and lasts for 4-10 days. It may take 10-12 days for a child to develop symptoms after exposure. They are contagious 1-2 days before onset of rash until the rash crusts.</span></li><li><b>Rubella: </b><span>Also called German measles. The rash and disease is usually mild and transient. The rash starts from face or neck and then to trunk and limbs. &nbsp;It is pink or light red in color. Major health concern from Rubella is in pregnant women. If a pregnant woman acquires Rubella in pregnancy it can cause significant damage to the fetus. It takes 2-3 weeks for a child to develop symptoms after getting exposed to Rubella. They are contagious 7 days before the onset of the rash to 14 days after the rash disappears.</span></li><li><b>Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease)</b><span>: &nbsp;The rashes begin with the classic slapped-cheek appearance. Bright red raised rashes appear abruptly over the cheeks, sparing area around the nose, mouth and eyes. Later on, red rashes spread to arms and trunk which fades into a lace like reticular pattern. Up to two weeks may elapse before a child exposed to the virus develops any symptoms. A child can transmit virus before onset of rash and up to 20 percent may not have any symptoms and still transmit the virus. </span></li><li><b>Roseola: </b><span>A pink rash, with either flat or raised lesions, starts to appear on the trunk and then spreads to the face, arms and legs.

These tests could also be a part of your regular follow up.</p><ul><li>Blood tests</li><li>Imaging: X-ray, Ultrasound,CT scan, MRI</li><li>Endoscopy, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy etc</li><li>Bone marrow tests, Lumbar puncture</li><li>Biopsy: a sample of the tissue is taken to test microscopically to make a certain diagnosis</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Screening</code><p>Cancers can be detected early by performing screening tests in apparently healthy persons. The cancers that can be screened are:</p><ul><li>Breast cancer: screened by Self breast examination and mammogram.</li><li>Cervical cancer: screened by ‘Pap smear’.</li><li>Colon cancer: screened by visualization of intestines through colonoscope, sigmoidoscope etc.</li><li>Prostate cancer: screened by physical examination and ‘PSA’ test.</li><li>Lung cancer: screened by special kind of X-ray called ‘low dose CT scan’.</li><li>Ovarian cancer: screened by blood tests and ultrasound.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>The treatment of cancer varies according to the type, size, stage and spread of cancer. The aim of cancer treatment is to cure the cancer (if in early stage), control its progression and ease the associated symptoms.</p><ul><li>Commonly there are three types of treatment options and are usually used in combination:<ul><li>Surgery: The cancer part is cut out from the affected body part.</li><li>Chemotherapy: The doctors use special kind of medicines to kill the cancer cells or to stop them from growing further.</li><li>Radiation therapy: The doctors use high energy radiation on the cancerous part to kill the cancer cells or to stop them from growing further.</li></ul></li><li>Other newer treatment methods are also being used these days like bone marrow transplant, hormone therapy, immune therapy and other special techniques (e.g. cutting off blood supply to tumor)</li><li>Supportive treatment: medicines and other therapy for pain, nutrition support, recreation therapy etc</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Follow up</code><p>Once you are diagnosed with cancer you need a regular follow up. Follow up involves review of history, physical examination and necessary investigations. The aim of follow up is to check for recurrence or spread, to prevent or early detect other cancers, treat ongoing problems related to cancer and address the long term physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer after treatment. In addition, the doctor will provide you counseling on nutrition, fertility, pain management etc as well as refer you for occupational/ vocational therapy as required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>At least one in three cancer cases are preventable and the number of cancer deaths could be reduced significantly by choosing a healthy lifestyle. You can prevent cancer by avoiding the above mentioned risk factors of cancer like smoking, alcoholism, poor diet, inactivity and obesity etc. Periodic screening and early detection are also effective preventive measures. You should get immunized for cervical cancer if available in your place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>');

It can affect any organ in the body but lungs (Pulmonary TB) are the most common site of infection. Other common sites of infection are bones, lymph nodes, kidneys, uterus, brain (meninges), skin, etc.', 'http://niroginepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tuberculosis.png', '<div> <ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. It can affect any organ in the body but lungs (Pulmonary TB) are the most common site of infection. Other common sites of infection are bones, lymph nodes, kidneys, uterus, brain (meninges), skin, etc.</p><p>Tuberculosis is transmitted from one person to another by inhalation of droplets released into the air by an infected person when they sneeze or cough. Transmission is high in crowded area with high humidity. Entry of bacteria into the lungs causes mild illness called primary tuberculosis. Usually it doesn’t lead to significant disease and resolves after body’s immune system traps and localises the organism into a small area in the lung called ghon’s focus where it remains dormant for long period. Later, when body defenses become weak, these dormant bacteria reactivate and cause significant disease called secondary tuberculosis. Most of the tuberculosis in adults are reactivation tuberculosis. A large proportion of population in developing countries have been exposed to TB and have dormant bacteria in the lungs and are at risk of reactivation tuberculosis. Tuberculosis had become a rare disease in developing countries but its prevalence is increasing after HIV/AIDS became common.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Natural course of Tuberculosis</code><p>There are two stages of tuberculosis</p><ol><li>Latent TB: Once infected with tuberculosis bacteria, one is never cured of it. Most of the time it lies dormant in the lungs without causing any symptoms and is called latent TB. The risk of reactivation increases when body’s immune system goes down. Latent TB needs to be treated, even in absence of symptoms, to prevent the risk of full blown active tuberculosis later. It is treated with isoniazid for six months. TB is not transmissible at this stage.</li><li>Active tuberculosis: This is when you develop signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. This may follow immediately after the first exposure without going into the latent phase or it can develop many years later after the first mildly symptomatic primary infection goes into dormancy. You can spread the disease during this stage.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms of active Tuberculosis</code><p>Here are some of the symptoms of active tuberculosis:</p><ul><li>cough for more than two weeks</li><li>streaks of blood in cough</li><li>low grade fever in da</li><li>night sweats</li><li>chest pain</li><li>unexplained weight loss</li><li>pallor (anemia)</li><li>anorexia; malaise with general weakness and other associated features</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Common Causes/ Risk Factors</code><p>Causative agent of tuberculosis is <em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em> in most of the cases. Other bacteria are <em>Mycobacterium Bovis</em> and <em>Mycobacterium Africanum</em>. Following conditions increase the risk of acquiring tuberculosis:</p><ul><li>Age: children and elderly are more at risk of infection</li><li>People with low immunity such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, etc.</li><li>First-generation immigrants from high-prevalence countries</li><li>Close contacts of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis</li><li>Overcrowded environments like prisons, collective dormitories</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Red Flag Signs/ When to seek Care</code><ul><li>Cough for more than two weeks</li><li>Blood in sputum/hemoptysis</li><li>Unexplained weight loss</li><li>Cough with chest pain</li><li>Continuous low grade fever for more than a week</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment Options</code><p>Active tuberculosis is diagnosed by the presence of abnormal chest xray in patient with risk factors who have above mentioned symptoms. When microscopic examination of sputum shows tuberculosis germ, it is called smear positive TB and is highly infectious. Even if not seen under microscope, the bacilli can grow in culture medium. It is then called culture positive TB. When bacilli is not seen under microscope and doesn’t grow in culture it is called culture negative and is less contagious.</p><p>Latent TB is diagnosed by skin test called PPD test or a blood test called Quantiferon test.</p><p>Both latent TB and active TB need to be treated. Latent TB needs treatment with a single drug for six months while active TB needs to be treated with a combination of drugs (3 -4) for 6-9 months. Completion of required dose and duration is essential for cure and to prevent emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis which are called multidrug resistant Tb (MDR) or extended drug resistance TB (XDR) and are very difficult to treat.</p><p>Anti-tubercular drugs are distributed free by government of Nepal under DOTS (directly observed treatment short course) program.</p><ul><li>Combination packs of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol are used. Injections of streptomycin may also be used where appropriate.</li><li>The needed combination is decided after thorough medical checkup.</li><li>Treatment duration, although called short course in the program name, extend between six to twelve months or more according to the type of TB.</li><li>Once diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis, start treatment and use a mask to prevent transmission of disease to others. Disease transmission decreases after about two weeks of starting the treatment.</li><li>Drug combinations should be strictly followed as prescription; otherwise there is risk of drug resistant tuberculosis. DOTS strategy uses directly observed treatment in which a near member of the family watches the patient swallow medications regularly.</li><li>BCG vaccination is given to infants by Nepal Government to protect from tuberculosis.</li><li>WHO recommends proper nutrition to make up for the losses and also to decrease the risk factors for tuberculosis. Maintain optimum nutritional status of the body so that loss of immunity is prevented.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Complications of Tuberculosis</code><ul><li>massive haemoptysis (coughing of blood)</li><li>cor-pulmonale (heart disease due to lungs disease)</li><li>atypical mycobacterial infection</li><li>aspergilloma</li><li>lung/pleural calcification which can be seen in chest x-rays</li><li>bronchiectasis</li><li>bronchopleural fistula (opening between airway and pleural covering of lungs</li></ul> </ul> </div>'),

Tingling is the prickling sensation also known as pins and needles and it is usually felt in hands and feet. Numbness is when one cannot feel any sensation in part of his/her body.', 'http://niroginepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pins-and-Needles.png', '<div> <ul> <code>Meaning: </code><p>Tingling and numbness are the loss of normal sensation in the various parts of body. Tingling is the prickling sensation also known as pins and needles and it is usually felt in hands and feet. Numbness is when one cannot feel any sensation in part of his/her body.</p><code>Why does it Matter?</code><p>You will generally experience numbness or pins and needles when you are sitting crossed-legs because awkward positions such as that press your nerves or blood vessels that supply to those nerves. When you have some disease that traps or presses the nerves, you will feel numbness or tingling, as it is those nerves that carry such sensations to the brain. It can sometimes be a sign of some serious diseases like diabetes or problem of the spine.</p><p>Tingling is experienced as an unpleasant feeling in a specific area like that of pin pricks or shooting pain which can travel down from arm to leg or any one of them. You do not feel anything even if you are pricked with needle on the specific area where you feel the numbness.</p><code>Causes:</code><p>There are various causes of tingling and numbness but only few of those that are common or important are discussed as follows:</p><ol><li><strong> Trapped nerve:</strong> Tingling and numbness can be caused by a trapped nerve due to back issues or prolapsed disc etc. The nerve gets trapped because of the pressure exerted on it hence causing pins and needles anywhere in the body, from head to toe, depending on where it is trapped. This may also impair the function of the part of body affected. There is a condition called carpel tunnel syndrome in which nerve trapping occurs at wrist resulting in the loss of grip as well as pain, tingling and numbness at affected hand.</li><li><strong> Pressure:</strong> If undue pressure is exerted on the nerves due to prolonged sitting on feet or wearing tight clothing, for example, it can cause tingling and numbness. This is usually reversible which means, if the pressure is relieved on time it gets better and has no serious consequences.</li><li><strong> Injury:</strong> Injury to a nerve can cause numbness and tingling in the part of body being supplied by the affected nerve. For example if nerve in neck is injured, numbness could be felt anywhere along the arm whereas back injury might cause the same in legs.</li><li><strong> Diabetes</strong>: When the blood sugar is not under control for several years, there can be damage in the small nerves beginning in the fingers and toes, hands and feet. This is called peripheral neuropathy. When you are unable to feel with your legs or hands, there is risk of injury from burn, prick, fall etc.</li><li><strong> Medicines:</strong> There are some medicines whose side effects are numbness or tingling resulting from the nerve damage. Such medicines include anticancer drugs, antiretroviral or antitubercular drugs, metronidazole etc. People who take a lot of alcohol and tobacco develop serious conditions that cause tingling or numbness.</li><li><strong> Vitamin Deficiency:</strong> Strict vegetarians and people with disease called pernicious anemia have deficiency of Vitamin B 12 which can cause tingling and numbness, apart from anemia.</li><li><strong> Diseases that damage nerves:</strong> There are several diseases which affect the nervous system and cause tingling or numbness. Some of them are stroke, brain tumors and multiple sclerosis. Though they are relatively rare as cause of numbness or tingling, they are very serious conditions.</li></ol><code>When to Seek Help?</code><ul><li>If you develop sudden weakness of limbs, loss of speech, unconsciousness or fall, control of your urine or stool, blurring of vision or blackout etc, you should immediately meet the doctor, preferably in the Emergency room.</li><li>If you have tingling or numbness following injury to head, neck or back or you get a sudden pain in the neck or back, it may be a serious condition that requires you to consult doctor immediately.</li><li>If you have tingling and numbness along with the manifestation of serious diseases like diabetes, you should be alarmed and consult the doctor.</li><li>You should also seek medical attention if you have attacks of tingling and numbness times and again, without obvious cause or you are not recovering completely.</li></ul><code>Treatment Options: </code><p>The likely cause of numbness or tingling primarily determines whether or not you need specific treatment, and if yes, which medicine, surgery or physical therapy to use. Some of the serious causes need immediate investigation and treatment through the emergency department while some are treated by regular outpatient follow up. You may be referred to specific specialists like neurologist or orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and definitive management.</p><p>However, there are certain things you may try yourself to reduce the symptoms of numbness and tingling. Those include:</p><ul><li>Loosening of any tight shoes or clothing</li><li>Avoiding lifting of heavy weight, poor posture or repetitive movements in order to avoid neck or back problems</li><li>Taking regular breaks at work, doing yoga and keeping good posture all the time</li><li>Shaking the limbs or moving toes or getting up if you are seating or leaning in the same position for a long time</li><li>Avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol</li><li>Stopping the medication causing numbness or tingling, if applicable</li><li>Control your diabetes with proper diet, exercise, medicine and regular follow up</li><li>Avoid being strict vegan, if possible. You need to take supplements as prescribed, if you have deficiency of Vitamin B 12</li><li>You may need to avoid certain risky activities like driving if you have bothersome numbness or tingling</li><li>Give importance to regular physiotherapy if your doctor has recommended it for your condition</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Related Topics: </code><p>Dizziness, Peripheral Neuropathy</p></ul> </div>'),

In SLE, however, your body produces antibodies that attack body’s own tissue and causes damage to the various organs. </span></p><p><span>Although the exact cause of SLE is not known, it is thought that some people are born with the a tendency to develop lupus that is triggered by a viral infection, chemical exposure or other unknown environmental factors. The disease can be mild or severe, and runs a chronic course with periods where the disease remains silent for some time and periods where many organs are affected and patient becomes very sick. Kidney involvement by lupus is a life threatening situation that may require dialysis and kidney transplantation. Lupus also increases risk of miscarriage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p>SLE has some known risk factors. These include:</p><ul><li><span>Females of reproductive age;</span></li><li><span>Estrogen containing contraceptives;</span></li><li><span>Inherited genetic predisposition in up to 10% cases;</span></li><li><span>Race – African American, Hispanic American and Asian have a higher chance of having an SLE;</span></li><li><span>Certain drugs can also cause SLE. These include, &nbsp;Procainamide, Hydralazine, Isoniazid. Typically, this kind of SLE does not involve internal organs of the body.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Symptoms depend on the organs involved. In early stages, the symptoms may be nonspecific, which sometimes can delay the diagnosis. Symptom severity fluctuates over periods with episodes of flare ups where symptoms are acute and severe. Some of the common symptoms are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fatigue;</span></li><li><span>Joint pain;</span></li><li><span>Fever;</span></li><li><span>Rash-typically over nose and cheeks called ‘butterfly rash’, made worse by sunlight;</span></li><li><span>Oral ulcers;</span></li><li><span>Fingers or toes that turn blue when exposed to cold;</span></li><li><span>Blood in urine;</span></li><li><span>Chest pain;</span></li><li><span>Difficulty breathing;</span></li><li><span>Depression;</span></li><li><span>Seizures;</span></li><li><span>Psychosis.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Severe and untreated SLE can cause many life-threatening complications, such as blood clots, multiple miscarriages, kidney failure, and heart diseases at early age. Treatment of lupus can also lead to increased risk of life-threatening infections. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>Diagnosis of lupus is difficult and is often delayed by many years. SLE is diagnosed by suggestive signs and symptoms and some of these supportive laboratory tests:</span></p><p><em><span>Blood Test: </span></em></p><ul><li><span>Almost all patients with SLE have a positive test for antinuclear antibody (ANA). However, positive ANA test alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of&nbsp;SLE. Several other antibodies are found in SLE.</span></li><li><span>Complete blood count;</span></li><li><span>Blood test to check kidney and liver function.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><em>Urine Test:</em>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>For presence of &nbsp;protein and &nbsp;blood.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><em>Kidney Biopsy:</em></span></p><ul><li><span>When Lupus affects kidney.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Other Tests:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Based on organ(s) affected by Lupus.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>There is no curative treatment for SLE at present. Treatment is aimed at suppressing the abnormally active immune system thereby preventing organ damage or provide symptomatic relief through medications. These medications have the potential for serious side effects including infection. So monitoring side effects is an important part of treatment. Commonly used medication groups to treat SLE are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);</span></li><li><span>Antimalarials-Hydroxychloroquine;</span></li><li><span>Topical steroids to skin or eyes;</span></li><li><span>Systemic steroids – Prednisone;</span></li><li><span>Immunosuppressive – Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, Cyclosporine;</span></li><li><span>When kidneys are severely affected dialysis and kidney transplant is needed;</span></li><li><span>In treatment-resistant lupus, monoclonal antibody and stem cell transplant may have role.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention of complications</code><p>The following steps can be taken to prevent the complications from SLE:</p><ul><li><span>Sun protection – sunglasses, sunscreen.</span></li><li><span>Smoking cessation.</span></li><li><span>Vaccination against influenza and pneumonia.</span></li><li><span>Avoid contact with sick person.</span></li><li><span>Treatment of associated conditions like hypertension or diabetes.</span></li><li><span>Avoid pregnancy when disease is active to prevent pregnancy loss and disease flare up.</span></li><li><span>Regular exercise.</span></li><li><span>Vitamin D and calcium supplement.</span></li></ul> </ul> </div>'),

There are also other special types of diabetes based on the causes of damage to the pancreas.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes also called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus occurs when pancreas produces little or no insulin. The cells in the pancreas that produce insulin are destroyed. Therefore, insulin is needed from the beginning to control blood sugar in type 1 DM. And as the cells producing insulin are destroyed this disease remains throughout your life with no complete cure till date. Type 1 DM appears earlier in life compared to type 2. Most commonly diagnosed in people less than 20 years old. It accounts for 10% of overall diabetes population.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or body becomes less sensitive to the insulin produced. The cells that produce insulin in pancreas are not destroyed and hence insulin is not required from the beginning to control blood sugar. It is commoner type of diabetes mellitus ( 90 % of all DM) and generally begins after age of 40. People with a family history of diabetes and who are overweight and obese may develop type 2 diabetes earlier. Since the cell producing insulin are intact, this type of DM can be managed with diet, weight reduction and exercise in the early stages. Subsequently they, need oral medication that stimulate insulin production from the pancreas. Over the years many people with type 2 diabetes need insulin from outside to keep blood sugar under control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Some common symptoms of diabetes mellitus are:</p><ul><li>Drinking water more than usual</li><li>Going to bathroom to urinate more often</li><li>Losing weight without effort</li><li>Feeling very hungry or tired</li><li>Cuts and wounds take longer time to heal</li><li>Having blurry vision</li><li>Tingling in your feet and hands</li><li>Sometimes an undiagnosed DM can present with complications called diabetic ketoacidosis where not only your blood sugars are high, you will be severely dehydrated, lethargic or sometimes comatose, kidney damage and life threatening acidosis.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Who is at risk for developing Diabetes Mellitus?</code><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Following conditions increase your risk of developing diabetes mellitus:</p><ul><li>Family history of diabetes in parents or siblings</li><li>Overweight and obesity</li><li>Age</li><li>Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise</li><li>Presence of other autoimmune diseases</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>High cholesterol and triglycerides level</li><li>Excessive alcohol consumption</li><li>Cigarette smoking</li><li>DM during pregnancy</li><li>Certain medication like steroids</li><li>Acute severe stress – these are usually transient</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eating high sugar diet doesn’t cause diabetes but it may unmask an underlying predisposition to develop diabetes. It will most likely make your diabetes control difficult if you already have diabetes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Diabetes is diagnosed by measuring blood glucose level. The best way to diagnose diabetes is to check a blood sugar level after 10-12 hours of not eating anything called fasting blood sugar level. Normally it should be between 70-100 mg/dl. If it is more than 126 mg/dl, it is called diabetes. If you are already experiencing symptoms of diabetes mentioned above, then a blood glucose level can be checked randomly without fasting. If it is higher than 200 mg/dl then a diagnosis of diabetes is made. Sometimes you may have all the risk factors for diabetes but your blood sugar level are within normal range. In these situation, you many undergo a test called glucose challenge test that will help in making a diagnosis of diabetes or a condition called impaired glucose tolerance also known as prediabetes. Another test that helps to make a diagnosis is called HBA1C. This test tells us about the your average blood sugar in last 3 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>You should always consult with your doctor about the treatment plan. Type I diabetes invariably requires insulin injections. . In case of type II diabetes, your doctor will ask you to control your blood sugar with modification of diet, and later give you some tablets to control your blood sugar level.</p><p>These are the common things you need to follow when you have diabetes:</p><ul><li>Healthy diet: Dietary control is the most important thing for a patient with diabetes.

The medical term for heart attack is <em>myocardial infarction</em>. Heart attack occurs when the blood flow to the heart is &nbsp;severely reduced or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs regular supply of blood and oxygen to survive.

These areas of fat accumulation are called </span><i><span>plaques</span></i><span>. Mostly of the time, &nbsp;these plaques grow slowly as they accumulate fat from the blood. Occasionally, these plaque rupture abruptly and a blood clot is formed rapidly within the vessel that completely blocks the blood flow to an area of the heart. If the blockage is released early by giving clot busting medications, the heart muscles in that area of heart can be rescued before they die permanently. If a large area of heart muscles dies, it can seriously put your life in danger. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p><span>Conditions that increase the chances of plaque formation in the blood vessels are the biggest risk factor for an heart attack.

People with diabetes can have a heart attack without chest pain as the nerves supplying the heart are damaged in diabetes. </span></li><li><span>Cold Sweat: Sudden excessive&nbsp;sweating is another symptom of heart attack.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shortness of breath: fluid start to build up in your lungs after a heart attack and cause difficulty in breathing. </span></li><li><span>Sudden dizziness: due to weak heart unable to pump enough blood to the brain.</span></li><li><span>Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion: sometimes a heart attack can masquerade as upset stomach with nausea and vomiting. </span></li><li><span>Cardiac arrest: A massive heart attack can completely stop your heart from beating. Most of the patient with cardiac arrest from a heart attack do not survive. </span></li></ul><p><span>A heart attack can come suddenly without any warning and cause cardiovascular collapse. More commonly, you will experience warning signs for days and weeks ahead. These warning signs include recurrent chest pain that comes on more frequently and with increasing intensity either on exertion or at rest. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>All severe chest pain are not from a heart attack. If you have severe chest pain, your doctor will order some blood tests to see if it is coming from your heart. Along with the blood test, you will need an ECG and echocardiogram. A final diagnosis of a heart attack from fat accumulation is made by coronary angiogram. During coronary angiogram, your doctor will inject a dye in the arteries of the heart via a long catheter inserted into your groin. Then your doctor will take x-ray of your heart that shows the blocked artery. If your doctor finds a blockage during angiography they can place a stent to open up the blockage. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>If you think you might be experiencing a heart attack you should seek medical help immediately and go to the emergency department of a local hospital. Your chance of survival depends on how quickly you reach hospital and receive clot removing treatments. If you reach hospital within 4- 6 hours of onset of symptoms, doctors can save your heart by giving a clot busting medicine through your vein or by placing a stent in the blocked artery. Sometimes you will need an emergent surgery to bypass the area of the blockage. If the heart attack is massive, your heart will fail to pump blood and fluid will build up in your lungs. You will need respirator to help you breath and medications to increase your blood pressure. </span><span>&nbsp;After you recover from an heart attack, your heart function might return back to normal or you will develop a weak heart called heart failure. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>There are several health behaviors that you can adopt to minimize the chances of getting a heart attack. Some of these include:</p><ul><li><span>Healthy lifestyle: Following a healthy lifestyle is very important to prevent heart attack. Exercising regularly and following a healthy diet, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods is important. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Maintain a healthy weight.</span></li><li><span>Certain types of health conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes make a heart attack more likely to occur. So controlling and managing such conditions can help lower the chances of getting a&nbsp;heart attack. &nbsp;Take all prescribed medicines regularly.</span></li><li>Quite smoking.</li><li>See your doctor for regular checkups.</li></ul></ul></div>'),

URI may occur at any time in a year; however it is usually more common in rainy days and during winter. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>Viruses are the most common cause of URI. Many viruses can cause URI but rhinovirus is the most common one. The virus &nbsp;spreads via air after a sick person coughs or sneezes. If your are close to the person with the cold, you may catch the virus. &nbsp;It can also spread by direct contact with infected people’s hand or other contaminated materials. If you touch your nose, eyes or mouth after the contact, you will catch the virus. Certain factors increase the risk of catching a cold. &nbsp;Younger age, smoking cigarettes, living in a crowded space, weak immune system increase the risk of getting the cold. URI in general is more common during winter months.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Most instances of he cold&nbsp;usually last for a week but sometimes may continue up to two weeks .

Sometimes you may need a chest x-ray or a throat swab. You should see your doctor if symptoms become worse due to suppression in immune system or due to a secondary infection or complications. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>There is no specific treatment for viral infection. Symptomatic relief is the objective. Antibiotics should not be used for viral URI unless there is a concern for a bacterial infection, which can occur if the common cold doesn’t resolve in two weeks. Below are some options for relief from the cold symptoms:</span></p><ul><li><span>Take paracetamol for fever and malaise. </span></li><li><span>Vapour rubs and inhalant decongestants can be applied to children’s clothing to provide relief from blocked nose in children over 3 months of age.</span></li><li><span>Nasal decongestants can be used but should be avoided in children.</span></li><li><span>Antihistamines are shown not to be beneficial; &nbsp;thus they should be avoided particularly in children.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Other home remedies that help alleviate symptoms are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Drink plenty of fluid and take adequate rest.</span></li><li><span>Fruit juices high in vitamin C, soups, gelatin, honey, lemon etc. help to ease congestion.</span></li><li><span>Gargle with warm salt water helps relieve throat pain; saline nasal drops also help ease congestion.</span></li><li><span>Steam inhalation is also a proven measure in easing URI&nbsp;symptoms.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>Ways to prevent and prevent the spread of URI include the following:</p><ul><li><span>Hand washing is the key to prevent spread of URI.

It is an warning sign that needs an urgent response as it can quickly develop into a full-blown stroke.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the &nbsp;symptoms of stroke?</code><p><span>Patients with stroke often do not seek medical help on their own, because they may not be in pain or they may not be able to appreciate that something has gone wrong. Often, a family member or an accompanying person is the first to notice the symptoms. The patient may suffer from variety of symptoms such as:</span></p><ul><li><span>a slurred speech or difficulty speaking;</span></li><li><span>inability to move certain parts of the body;</span></li><li><span> numbness of the face, arm or leg;</span></li><li><span>drooping of one side of the mouth;</span></li><li><span>difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;</span></li><li><span>headache;</span></li><li><span>difficulty walking and balancing;</span></li><li><span>dizziness, fainting;</span></li><li><span>patients may lose consciousness if the stroke is massive. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the different types of stroke?</code><p><span>There are two types of stroke: </span></p><ul><li><span><em>Ischemic:</em> Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain. The clot may be formed within the blood vessels of the brain or the clot can form outside the brain, mainly in the heart and large vessels, that is swept through the circulation to the brain. About 85% of all strokes are ischemic stroke. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span><em> Hemorrhagic.</em> In hemorrhagic stroke, blood vessels in the brain rupture and bleed into the brain tissue causing death of the brain cells. Poorly-controlled hypertension and a brain aneurysm (ballooning of the blood vessel secondary to a defect in the wall of the blood vessel that makes it weak and prone to rupture) are two most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke. Other causes of hemorrhagic stroke are overtreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants) and blood disorder that causes low platelets. Hemorrhagic stroke can be further divided into <em>intraparenchymal bleed</em> and <em>subarachnoid bleed,</em> which are treated differently and have different prognosis. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the risk factors for stroke?</code><p><span>The risk factors that increase your risk of stroke are similar to the risk factors that increase your risk of a heart attack. These risk factors can be divided into modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. &nbsp;By controlling the modifiable risk factors, up to 50% of stroke can be prevented. </span></p><ul><li><span>Modifiable risk factors: </span><ul><li><span>Lifestyle factors: Overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, heavy drinking and use of illicit drugs like cocaine and amphetamine, cigarette smoking.</span></li><li><span>Medical risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><span>Non modifiable risk factors: </span><ul><li><span>Old age &gt; 55 years;</span></li><li><span>men are at higher risk than women;</span></li><li><span>family history of stroke, TIA or heart attacks;</span></li><li><span>African americans have higher risk of stroke compared to&nbsp;other races.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is stroke diagnosed?</code><p><span>Stroke is diagnosed based on the presence of one of the symptoms discussed above and physical examination demonstrating a weakness on some part of the body. To confirm the diagnosis, the type of stroke is identified and other conditions that may mimic a stroke (e.g. brain tumor) are ruled out. Your doctor will order a CT scan or an MRI of the brain or a cerebral angiogram. &nbsp;Your doctor will also order some of the following&nbsp;tests to identify the underlying cause of the stroke:</span></p><ul><li><span> Blood tests to evaluate blood glucose, lipid profile, coagulation profile and various other tests.</span></li><li><span>Carotid ultrasound &nbsp;to assess large blood vessels in your neck.</span></li><li><span>Echocardiography &nbsp;to assess your heart.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How do you treat stroke?</code><p><span>Management of stroke depends on the types of stroke. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Treatment of ischemic stroke is aimed towards quickly restoring the blood flow to the brain. This is achieved by injecting “clot busting” medicines into the vein if you reach hospital within 4-6 hours of onset of symptoms. If more time has elapsed since, &nbsp;your chance of full recovery will be dramatically reduced. You will be given aspirin to reduce further risk of stroke. Doctors may recommend&nbsp;other procedures such as,&nbsp;carotid endarterectomy, balloon angioplasty and stent placements to open the narrowed arteries with the aim of reducing your risk of future strokes. </span></p><p><span>Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke focuses on control of the bleeding and decreasing pressure from building up inside the brain. Drugs to lower the pressure are given to prevent further bleeding. If the area bleeding is large, surgery may be performed in the brain itself to remove the blood and relieve pressure. If the bleeding is from an aneurysm, surgery is performed to remove the aneurysm. In subarachnoid bleeding, a medicine called nimodipine is given to prevent further spasm of the blood vessels. </span></p><p><span> As mentioned above,&nbsp;if you experience a “mini-stroke” &nbsp;you need to seek urgent medical care.</span></p><p><span>Rehabilitation and physical therapy is an integral part of stroke care. Patients with stroke often have problem with breathing, swallowing, balancing and vision. A rigorous rehabilitation can lead to significant regaining of strength and recovery of functions. Stroke rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary approach consisting of a neurologist, nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist, speech therapist and a psychologist or a psychiatrist. </span></p></ul> </div>'),

Schizophrenic people often hear voices which aren’t there and may see the scene which isn’t real. They may feel other people are trying to hurt them. Actually, the word schizophrenia is comprised of two Greek words- skhizein meaning to split and phren meaning mind. Though the whole literary meaning of the word directs towards splitted mind, but schizophrenia isn’t considered as split personality or multiple personality. The schizophrenic patient also having the problem of multiple personality is rarely noticed which is known as complicated schizophrenia.</p><p>Schizophrenia most commonly starts at the age of 13-30. Male may develop the symptoms earlier than Female. This type of mental problem rarely occurs after 30 and people usually do not develop the schizophrenia after the age of 45. It is believed that 1 percent of the total population is suffered from this mental disease. Some research shows it is the result of faulty neuronal development in the brain of the fetus.</p><p><span><strong>Symptoms :</strong></span></p><p>Symptoms of schizophrenia may be classified into three categories:</p><ol><li>Pshychotic symptoms : a person is distorted to hallucinations- hearing or seeing things that are not there, delusions- beliefs that are not true and trouble organizing thoughts and movements.</li><li>Negative symptoms : a person becomes weak to react normally showing emotions, facial expressions and motivations.</li><li>Cognitive symptoms : a person will gradually become withdrawn. The process of thinking will be depressed and unble to concentrate resulting the person in problem to calculate the information to make any decision.</li></ol><code>Factors influencing Schizophrenia :</code><p>Experts believe several factors are responsible to the onset of schizophrenia but no one is sure. They think the genes, the environment and the brain chemistry may play the vital role. Many evidences suggest that genetic and environmental factors act together to bring about schizophrenia. Here, for the convenience, it is listed one by one as below –</p><ol><li>Genetic inheritance : If a family member had the problem of schizophrenia then there is more chance to inherit it genetically.</li><li>Chemical imbalance in the brain : It is believed that people with schizophrenia has the imbalance of brain chemicals, viz. dopamin, glutamate and serotonin.</li><li>Family relationships : If there is not good relationship among family members then it is more likely to develop schizophrenia.</li><li>Environmental factors : It may be triggered by environmental viral infection or immune disorder.</li><li>Misuse of drugs : Misuse of drugs or use of substance will also trigger the schizophrenia.</li></ol><code>Diagnosis and Tests :</code><p>The present method of differential diagnosis of schizophrenia rely on the symptoms and signs shown by the victims. By ruling out other mental disorders and making sure the symptoms are not due to abuse of drugs, medication or a medical condition, doctors do the following exams :</p><ul><li>Physical exam – knowing the whole history and behavioral activities of the patient. If it proves the patient has hallucination, delusion, disorganized speech and catatonic behavior, then it is 70% confirmed that he or she has the problem of schizophrenia.</li><li>Screening tests – doctors may observe MRI or CT scan.</li><li>Psychiatric evaluation- doctor may check the mental status of the patient by observing appearance and demeanor and asking about suicidal thoughts. This may also include the discussion of family and personal history.</li></ul><code>Treatments and Therapies :</code><p>Since the cause of schizophrenia is still unclear, treatments focus on eliminating the symptoms of the disease. This include :</p><ul><li>Antipsychotic medication – there are lots of medicines to diminish the symptoms of schizophrenia which is usually given on daily basis in pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotics are given by injections once or twice a month. Side effects may arise in the beginning of medication period which go away after a few days. There are two major types of antipsychotic medication, viz. typical or conventional and atypical or new generation. Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine etc belong under typical and clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone etc belong under the category of atypical psychotic medication.</li><li>Recovery and rehabilitation – while there is no any proper medication for schizophrenia it is more emphasized in proper rehabilitation of the patient.</li><li>Psychosocial treatments – after the patient is recovering nicely the psychosocial treatments are also carried out such as attending school or work. Such treatment strengthens their will power and are less likely to have relapses.</li><li>Yoga and meditation – now-a-days yoga and meditation are also used side by side to cure psychotic diseases.

But it can worsen the pain if you already have an ulcer. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes and risk factors</code><p>There are several causes for the peptic ulcer diseases, ranging from bacterial infection to genetic predisposition. Some are discussed below:</p><ul><li><b>Helicobacter pylori infection:</b><ul><li><span>Majority of cases of gastric and duodenal ulcer are attributed to infection by &nbsp;H. pylori. It resides &nbsp;in the inner lining of the stomach wall, where it causes inflammation by the release of toxic compounds. </span></li><li><span>Helicobacter pylori is present in 30-60% of patients with gastric ulcers and nearly 70% of patients with duodenal ulcers. In developing countries, about 80% of the population may be infected with this bacteria by the age of 20 years. </span></li></ul></li><li><b>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</b><span> Regular use of painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac etc. on high dose can cause ulcers. Factors such as advanced age, simultaneous use of steroids will make you more prone towards developing an ulcer.</span></li><li><b><b>Too much acid production: </b><span>Diseases that increase acid production in the stomach can cause peptic ulcer disease. One of such disease is called zollinger-ellison syndrome.</span></b></li><li><b>Smoking:</b><span> Smoking increases your risk of ulcer. It delays healing of the ulcer and medicines to treat the disease&nbsp;become less effective if you smoke. It also increases the risk of ulcer perforation.</span></li><li><b>Other risk factors </b><span>: Heavy alcohol drinking, family history of PUD, old age, and concomitant use of oral steroids are also associated with higher risk of having a PUD.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms/Complications</code><ul><li><span>Pain: a burning pain felt in the upper abdomen is the most common symptom of PUD. Pain is felt more during empty stomach, worse at nights and may be relieved by eating food. </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Bleeding : the ulcer can erode into a blood vessel and cause bleeding which could be life threatening. It could present as dark stool or vomiting of blood. </span></li><li><span>Perforation: ulcer could erode all the way through the wall and cause perforation. It presents with a sudden severe and sharp pain in the abdomen, different from regular pain of PUD.&nbsp;This needs an emergent surgery.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Obstruction: Scarring leading to intestinal obstruction resulting in nausea/vomiting and weight loss. </span></li></ul><p><span>If you think you have peptic ulcer disease and you are losing weight, it is a danger sign of possible stomach cancer. You should see your doctor as soon as possible. Similarly dark stool is a danger sign of intestinal bleeding and you should contact your doctor immediately. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>PUD is diagnosed through the use of various tests and imaging/visualization methods. These include:</p><ul><li><span>Tests to diagnose H. pylori infection: your doctor will order a blood test or a stool test or a breath test to diagnose the infection. It depends on local availability of the test. If the test is positive you will need treatment with antibiotics.</span></li><li><span>Tests to visualize the ulcer: </span><ul><li><span>Endoscopy is done to visualize the ulcer. It is particularly helpful in identifying lesions too small to detect by X ray examination. Your doctor also can take a biopsy to rule out cancer during endoscopy..</span></li><li><span>Large ulcer can sometimes be diagnosed by barium swallow. In barium swallow, mixture of barium and water is swallowed followed by the X ray. Ulcer areas coated by barium can be seen on the X ray. Both gastric and duodenal ulcers appear as craters with well defined margins on the X ray examination. </span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>PUD is treated with lifestyle modification, medicine, endoscopy or&nbsp;surgery. </span></p><ul><li><span><em>Lifestyle modification:</em> Everyone who has PUD should stop smoking cigarettes, limit alcohol intake and avoid excessive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Healthy diet with fruits and vegetables may help in healing of the ulcer. </span></li><li><span><em>Medicines:</em> You will need two groups&nbsp;of medicine. One group is a set of&nbsp;three antibiotics that you will take for 2-3 weeks to treat the H. pylori infection. The second group is of acid lowering medicines&nbsp;like ranitidine and pantoprazole. Antacids are taken to relieve the pain and burning sensation.</span></li><li><span><em>Endoscopy or&nbsp;Surgery:</em> If you have bleeding complications from ulcer, it can be stopped by endoscopic procedures and local instillation of medication at the bleeding ulcer. Occasionally bleeding might be so severe that you might need surgery. </span></li></ul></ul></div>'),

It is caused by the bacteria <em>Treponema pallidum </em>and is common in both male and female. It usually starts by causing painless sores, called chancres or rashes on the genitals, mouth, anus, or rectum. According to the symptoms seen and the duration of the disease syphilis has been divided into three stages. It can cause serious damage to various organs if not treated properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p>Syphilis is transmitted from syphilis infected persons to healthy ones through genital, oral or anal sex or from infected mother to fetus during pregnancy or to new-born baby while giving birth. Syphilis is caused by spiral shaped bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum </em>where the spiral shape allows it to burrow into mucous membranes or enter through minute breaks in the skin. Syphilis doesn’t pass through toilet seats, shared utensils or casual contact. Less commonly, syphilis can be passed through kisssing if broken skin comes into contact. The factors that can increase a person’s risk of infection can be listed as below :</p><ul><li>Unprotected sex</li><li>Multiple sex partners</li><li>HIV infection</li><li>Man who makes sexual relationship with men.</li></ul><code> Symptoms</code><p>The&nbsp;symptoms of syphilis&nbsp;are different in different stages of infection which are divided into three categories as below :</p><ul><li>Primary&nbsp;stage : After <em>Treponema pallidum </em>&nbsp;infection, the primary symptom will manifest with a chancre, usually within 21 days. They look like small circular sores which are painless, called chancre. Such chancres maybe seen inside lips too.&nbsp;Being these chancres usually painless and internal, they can be easily missed by both patients and doctors. Without treatment, a chancre will heal in anywhere from three to six weeks. The chancre contains the infectious bacteria, this stage is highly contagious. Any contact with the chancre can spread the infection.</li><li>Secondary stage : If primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary stage of syphilis may develop. It occurs within 4 to 10 weeks of a primary infection. This stage is characterized by a skin rash on almost any part of the body, including sores inside the mouth, vagina or anus. The copper colored rashes of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Fever, enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, weight loss, hair loss, headaches, joint aches and muscle aches have been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis. If this secondary stage of the infection is not treated, the infection can progress to tertiary stage of syphilis which is very complicated and severe. But sometimes, syphilis will show no symptoms at all, which is called latent syphilis.</li><li>Tertiary stage : The last stage of infection is known as tertiary syphilis. It&nbsp;is the most serious stage of infection. It’s characterized by major diseases of the skin, bones, heart, liver, and other organs.&nbsp;Neurosyphilis, arguably the most severe complication, affects the brain and is, by far, the most difficult to treat. This stage can be life-threatening. Few symptoms of tertiary syphilis are:<ul><li>blindness</li><li>deafness</li><li>mental illness</li><li>memory loss</li><li>destruction of soft tissue and bone</li><li>neurological disorders</li><li>meningitis</li><li>heart disease</li><li>neurosyphilis</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis of syphilis</code><p>There are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis : treponemal tests and non-treponemal tests. Treponemal tests identify antibodies to the causative organism and non-treponemal tests identify the body’s response to the infection but not to the organism itself.&nbsp;The blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called VDRL and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests must be followed by a treponemal test.</p><code>Treatment of syphilis</code><p>Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics. Penicillin IM is considered the drug of choice, but other antibiotics like doxycycline, tetracycline, azithromycin,&nbsp; should be used for a person who is allergic to penicillin.</p><p>Actually, penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis in all stages. Treatment with penicillin is safe during pregnancy too. Treatment kills the bacteria and prevents further organ damage, but will not reverse damage to the organs that has already occurred.</p><code>Preventive measures of syphilis</code><p>There is no vaccine available to prevent syphilis. Safe-sex practices, including condom use, can only prevent syphilis. But if the infectious chancre is located in a body are unprotected by a condom then only condom will not work.&nbsp; Washing or cleansing after sexual activity cannot prevent the infection. Neonatal syphilis is preventable by treating the mother early in her pregnancy.</p></ul></div>'),

It may take from few days up to few weeks for the person to develop pneumonia after inhalation of the organism depending on the type of organism, amount inhaled and immune status of the person.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms:</code><p><span>The symptoms of pneumonia can be mild or could be life threatening depending on type and amount of microorganism and age and general health of the person. &nbsp;Signs and symptoms of pneumonia include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fever, which may occur with chills and rigor.</span></li><li><span>Cough that &nbsp;may produce yellow or bloody sputum.</span></li><li><span>Difficulty breathing with rapid fast breathing.</span></li><li><span>Chest pain which is sharp on deep inspiration. </span></li><li><span>Some may also have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</span></li><li><span>Altered mental status in elderly.</span></li><li><span>People at extremes of age and weak immune system may not develop fever and instead may become hypothermic.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As severity of pneumonia increases, the patient may become lethargic. The patient may turn blue and show signs of labored breathing, which are danger signs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>Most forms of pneumonia are caused by the bacteria and viruses present in the air we breath.</span></p><p><em><span>Bacteria:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Streptococcus pneumoniae – the most common cause of pneumonia.</span></li><li><span>Mycoplasma pneumoniae – causes “walking pneumonia”.</span></li><li><span>Staphylococcus aureus.</span></li><li><span>Klebsiella pneumoniae.</span></li><li><span>Tuberculosis.</span></li><li><span>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Viruses:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Influenza.</span></li><li><span>Respiratory syncytial virus-more common in children less than 5 years.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Fungi:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Fungi found in soil and bird droppings ( Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis).&nbsp;</span>This is relatively uncommon, seen mainly in people with chronic illness and weak immune system.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Pneumonia can be classified into three types based on where you got the infection. If a person was at home or in the community, it is called community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patient may develop pneumonia&nbsp;during hospital stays&nbsp;for other chronic illness.&nbsp;This form of infection is&nbsp;called hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). A person on a ventilator for a long duration may also develop pneumonia, which called ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The common organisms that cause pneumonia in these different setting are slightly different and so are the treatment options and the prognosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p><span>People with the following conditions are at risk of pneumonia:</span></p><ul><li><span>Smokers: the defense mechanisms of lungs (cough, mucus clearance, etc.) are decreased due to smoking.</span></li><li><span>Older age people.</span></li><li><span>Structural lung diseases like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis &nbsp;increase the chances of pneumonia. </span></li><li><span>Alcoholics: aspiration of material into airways causes infection of lungs. </span></li><li><span>Viral infections like influenza.</span></li><li><span>Weak immune system: HIV, malnutrition (especially in children), medicines that suppress immune system ( like steroids, anti cancer drugs).</span></li><li><span>Exposure to bird droppings (Chlamydia pneumoniae), poultry (bird flu) or farm animals (Q fever) increases the risk of certain types of pneumonia.</span></li><li><span>Infants and young children are likely develop respiratory insufficiency because of pneumonia.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek medical care</code><p><span>Early treatment of pneumonia can save lives, especially of infants and small children. So it is wise to seek care when fever and fast breathing is seen. The following signs warrant an urgent need to seek medical care:</span></p><ul><li><span>Bluish discoloration of lips or fingers suggests critically low oxygen exchange by the lungs.</span></li><li><span>Poor feeding in infants; inability to suck.</span></li><li><span>Distressed breathing: noisy breathing with movement of neck muscles on respiration.</span></li><li><span>Inability to speak full sentences due to breathlessness.</span></li><li><span>Chest indrawing, especially in children.</span></li><li><span>Lethargy or unconsciousness is present in advanced disease and may obscure other danger signs like difficulty breathing.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment options</code><p><span>In addition to history and physical exam, chest x-ray, blood and sputum tests are done to make the diagnosis for pneumonia. Additional tests may be needed based on clinical situation.&nbsp;</span><span>Pneumonia is treated by antibiotics and proper supportive measures. Severe pneumonia needs hospitalization. Mild cases can be treated at home.</span></p><p><span>Antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, azithromycin, or cephalosporin are commonly used to treat bacterial pneumonia. Paracetamol or Acetaminophen can be given for fever. Nebulized saline helps to clear secretions and make breathing easier. </span></p><p><span>If not properly treated on time, pneumonia can be complicated by accumulation of &nbsp;fluid/pus around the lungs. It can also spread the bacteria through blood to bone (osteomyelitis), brain (meningitis), or other tissues of the body. But respiratory failure is the most serious complication of pneumonia. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prevention</strong></p><p><span>Vaccination against Influenza and pneumonia help prevent this disease&nbsp;or its complication.&nbsp;</span><span>Pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced to immunization schedule for infants in many developing countries fairly&nbsp;recently.&nbsp;</span><span>Stopping smoking and alcohol use improves airway defense mechanisms and helps prevent pneumonia.</span></p></ul> </div>');

The exact association between strep infection and rheumatic fever is not clear but it’s thought to be immune mediated. The streptococcal bacteria contains a protein similar to the one found in the certain tissues of the body mainly heart, joints, skin and central nervous system. Strep throat, if not treated on time or inadequately treated, the immune system cells that would normally target the bacteria; may also target the these tissues resulting in inflammation of those tissues.

(1, 'Learning new vocabulary during deep sleep', '<div><ul><p> Sleeping time is sometimes considered unproductive time. This raises the question whether the time spent asleep could be used more productively — e.g. for learning a new language? To date sleep research focused on the stabilization and strengthening (consolidation) of memories that had been formed during preceding wakefulness. However, learning during sleep has rarely been examined. There is considerable evidence for wake-learned information undergoing a recapitulation by replay in the sleeping brain. The replay during sleep strengthens the still fragile memory traces und embeds the newly acquired information in the preexisting store of knowledge.</p><div><p> If re-play during sleep improves the storage of wake-learned information, then first-play — i.e., the initial processing of new information — should also be feasible during sleep, potentially carving out a memory trace that lasts into wakefulness. This was the research question of Katharina Henke, Marc Züst und Simon Ruch of the Institute of Psychology and of the Interfaculty Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep” at the University of Bern, Switzerland. These investigators now showed for the first time that new foreign words and their translation words could be associated during a midday nap with associations stored into wakefulness. Following waking, participants could reactivate the sleep-formed associations to access word meanings when represented with the formerly sleep-played foreign words. The hippocampus, a brain structure essential for wake associative learning, also supported the retrieval of sleep-formed associations. The results of this experiment are published open access in the scientific journal&nbsp;<em>Current Biology</em>.</p> <code>The brain cells’ active states are central for sleep-learning</code><p> The research group of Katharina Henke examined whether a sleeping person is able to form new semantic associations between played foreign words and translation words during the brain cells’ active states, the so-called “Up-states.” When we reach deep sleep stages, our brain cells progressively coordinate their activity. During deep sleep, the brain cells are commonly active for a brief period of time before they jointly enter into a state of brief inactivity. The active state is called “Up-state” and the inactive state “Down-state.” The two states alternate about every half-second.</p><p> Semantic associations between sleep-played words of an artificial language and their German translations words were only encoded and stored, if the second word of a pair was repeatedly (2, 3 or 4 times) played during an Up-state. E.g., when a sleeping person heard the word pairs “tofer = key” and “guga = elephant,” then after waking they were able to categorize with a better-than-chance accuracy whether the sleep-played foreign words denominated something large (“Guga”) or small (“Tofer”). “It was interesting that language areas of the brain and the hippocampus — the brain’s essential memory hub — were activated during the wake retrieval of sleep-learned vocabulary because these brain structures normally mediate wake learning of new vocabulary,” says Marc Züst, co-first-author of this paper. “These brain structures appear to mediate memory formation independently of the prevailing state of consciousness — unconscious during deep sleep, conscious during wakefulness.”</p> <code>Memory formation does not require consciousness</code><p> Besides its practical relevance, this new evidence for sleep-learning challenges current theories of sleep and theories of memory. The notion of sleep as an encapsulated mental state, in which we are detached from the physical environment is no longer tenable. “We could disprove that sophisticated learning be impossible during deep sleep,” says Simon Ruch, co-first-author. The current results underscore a new theoretical notion of the relationship between memory and consciousness that Katharina Henke published in 2010 (N<em>ature Reviews Neuroscience</em>). “In how far and with what consequences deep sleep can be utilized for the acquisition of new information will be a topic of research in upcoming years,” says Katharina Henke.</p> <code>Decoding sleep</code><p> The research group of Katharina Henke is part of the Interfaculty Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep: From Neurons to Health &amp; Mind” (IRC). Decoding Sleep is a large, interdisciplinary research project that is financed by the University of Bern, Switzerland. Thirteen research groups in medicine, biology, psychology, and informatics are part of the IRC. The aim of these research groups is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in sleep, consciousness, and cognition.</p><p> The reported study was carried out in collaboration with Roland Wiest who is affiliated with the Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging (SCAN) at the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, University of Bern. Both research groups also belong to the BENESCO consortium, which consists of 22 interdisciplinary research groups specialized in sleep medicine, epilepsy and research on altered states of consciousness.</p></div></ul></div>', 'Sleeping time is sometimes considered unproductive time.

But I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at the age of 26, seven years after suffering from it,” shared Khanal.</p><p>The disease shows different symptoms in different persons including difficulty in movement and speaking, trembling, rigidity, postural difficulties, lack of confidence, nervousness, memory loss, loss of taste and smell, among others.</p><p>Similarly, actor Shrestha, who has been diagnosed with the disease, shared, “I tried everything from physiotherapy, acupressure to radiotherapy but the symptoms that I had developed did not subside. Later, Dr Sarvottam Shrestha said I was suffering from Parkinson’s.”</p><p>“I could not drive, hold a spoon, or even put on shoes. Later a doctor from Japan Dr Takaomi Taira first tried exercises, and when that did not work he&nbsp; suggested I needed a Deep Brain Stimulation&nbsp;(DBS) surgery and installed a pacemaker,” shared Shrestha.</p><p>Shrestha also expressed the irony of the situation where being an actor, due to his condition, he finds it challenging to emote and express, as Parkinson’s also affects a person’s ability to show facial expressions. Nevertheless, his positive attitude and humour were intact while sharing his story with the audience.</p><p>Likewise, Tilak Sapkota, a Hotel Management teacher who was diagnosed with the degenerative disorder six years ago, shared that the problem started with his hands. “My face gradually started to lose its expressions and people actually started noticing it. My wife took me to a few neurologists. After visiting 3-4 doctors, we came to know that it was Parkinson’s. My wife was my biggest support then.”</p><p>Medication, physical exercise, psychological strength, will power, and support from family and friends are the best ways to keep moving, shared the patients.</p><p>The documentary also showed how patients visited shamans to understand and find solution to the symptoms they were suffering from because they had not been diagnosed yet, mainly because Parkinson’s disease was not out in the light, not thought to be a condition that could be affecting the population.</p><p>But the patients shared how it is real and how they came in terms with their diagnosis. And though the disorder is not reversible, the condition can definitely be treated and controlled with medication. Dopamine and related medicines can help minimise the effects of the disease.</p><p>The documentary was followed by a panel discussion with panelists Khanal, Shrestha, Bhavana Rana, Neurologist Dr Baburam Pokharel, Geriatric Physician Dr Ramesh Kandel and Clinical Psychologist Pramesh Man Pradhan.</p><p>Medical experts and scientists have been conducting a stem cell research in Australia to find a solution to Parkinson’s.</p><p>“The cause of the disorder cannot easily be ascertained. There could be various reasons. Change in the genetics can be one of the causes of the degenerative disease. Apart from that, people who work with pesticides have high chances of suffering from Parkinson’s. Exposure to or consumption of neurotoxin MPTP directly or indirectly could also cause the symptoms to begin. Likewise unadministered use of medications can also be harmful and could at some point of time induce Parkinson’s,” shared Dr Pokharel explaining the possibilities.</p><p>“I say Parkinson’s is way better than other neuro-degenerative diseases because at least it can be diagnosed and controlled. Most of the neurological diseases have not been identified yet, forget the treatment,” stated Dr Pokharel.</p><p>The panel members also raised the issue of there not being any government facility that would deal with the neurological disorders, where people could go for diagnosis and treatment. This has created further difficulties to the people who suffer from Parkinson’s and other neurological disorders because the private institutions are not only expensive but not really focused on the specific cause. Having a government facility focused on this sector would be extremely helpful.</p><p>The panel discussion also shared challenges faced by the family members or caretakers of persons suffering from Parkinson’s. Leading this discussion was Bhavana Rana whose mother has Parkinson’s. She shared with the audience her experience in this regard and how to best take care of a person who is suffering from the disorder, highlighting the importance of being positive and loving towards the patients.</p></div></ul>', 'One per cent of people above 60 years of age suffer from Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system.

Lower-than-normal zinc levels may contribute to high blood pressure (hypertension) by altering the way the kidneys handle sodium.</p><div><p> Zinc deficiency is common in people with chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. People with low zinc levels are also at a higher risk for hypertension. The way in which the kidneys either excrete sodium into the urine or reabsorb it into the body — specifically through a pathway called the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) — also plays a role in blood pressure control. Less sodium in the urine typically corresponds with higher blood pressure. Recent research has suggested that zinc may help regulate proteins that in turn regulate the NCC, but a direct link between zinc-deficiency-induced hypertension has not been examined.</p><p> Researchers compared male mice with zinc deficiency to healthy controls with normal zinc levels. The zinc-deficient mice developed high blood pressure and a corresponding decrease in urinary sodium excretion. The control group did not experience the same changes. A small group of the zinc-deficient mice were fed a zinc-rich diet partway through the study. Once the animals’ zinc reached adequate levels, blood pressure began to drop and urinary sodium levels increased. “These significant findings demonstrate that enhanced renal [sodium] reabsorption plays a critical role in [zinc-deficiency]-induced hypertension,” the research team wrote.</p><p> “Understanding the specific mechanisms by which [zinc deficiency] contributes to [blood pressure] dysregulation may have an important effect on the treatment of hypertension in chronic disease settings,” the researchers added.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>', 'Zinc deficiency may play a role in high blood pressure.

About a decade ago, it was found that these cells also provide another level of protection. They have little fingers, called microvilli, that sense the environment, and warn the organs they cover that there is an invader and an immune response is needed.</p><p>Drinking baking soda, the MCG scientists think, tells the spleen — which is part of the immune system, acts like a big blood filter and is where some white blood cells, like macrophages, are stored — to go easy on the immune response. “Certainly drinking bicarbonate affects the spleen and we think it’s through the mesothelial cells,” O’Connor says.</p><p>The conversation, which occurs with the help of the chemical messenger acetylcholine, appears to promote a landscape that shifts against inflammation, they report.</p><p>In the spleen, as well as the blood and kidneys, they found after drinking water with baking soda for two weeks, the population of immune cells called macrophages, shifted from primarily those that promote inflammation, called M1, to those that reduce it, called M2. Macrophages, perhaps best known for their ability to consume garbage in the body like debris from injured or dead cells, are early arrivers to a call for an immune response.</p><p>In the case of the lab animals, the problems were hypertension and chronic kidney disease, problems which got O’Connor’s lab thinking about baking soda.</p><p>One of the many functions of the kidneys is balancing important compounds like acid, potassium and sodium. With kidney disease, there is impaired kidney function and one of the resulting problems can be that the blood becomes too acidic, O’Connor says. Significant consequences can include increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.</p><p>“It sets the whole system up to fail basically,” O’Connor says. Clinical trials have shown that a daily dose of baking soda can not only reduce acidity but actually slow progression of the kidney disease, and it’s now a therapy offered to patients.</p><p>“We started thinking, how does baking soda slow progression of kidney disease?” O’Connor says.</p><p>That’s when the anti-inflammatory impact began to unfold as they saw reduced numbers of M1s and increased M2s in their kidney disease model after consuming the common compound.</p><p>When they looked at a rat model without actual kidney damage, they saw the same response. So the basic scientists worked with the investigators at MCG’s Georgia Prevention Institute to bring in healthy medical students who drank baking soda in a bottle of water and also had a similar response.</p><p>“The shift from inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile is happening everywhere,” O’Connor says. “We saw it in the kidneys, we saw it in the spleen, now we see it in the peripheral blood.”</p><p>The shifting landscape, he says, is likely due to increased conversion of some of the proinflammatory cells to anti-inflammatory ones coupled with actual production of more anti-inflammatory macrophages. The scientists also saw a shift in other immune cell types, like more regulatory T cells, which generally drive down the immune response and help keep the immune system from attacking our own tissues. That anti-inflammatory shift was sustained for at least four hours in humans and three days in rats.</p><p>The shift ties back to the mesothelial cells and their conversations with our spleen with the help of acetylcholine. Part of the new information about mesothelial cells is that they are neuron-like, but not neurons O’Connor is quick to clarify.</p><p>“We think the cholinergic (acetylcholine) signals that we know mediate this anti-inflammatory response aren’t coming directly from the vagal nerve innervating the spleen, but from the mesothelial cells that form these connections to the spleen,” O’Connor says.</p><p>In fact, when they cut the vagal nerve, a big cranial nerve that starts in the brain and reaches into the heart, lungs and gut to help control things like a constant heart rate and food digestion, it did not impact the mesothelial cells’ neuron-like behavior.</p><p>The affect, it appears, was more local because just touching the spleen did have an effect.</p><p>When they removed or even just moved the spleen, it broke the fragile mesothelial connections and the anti-inflammatory response was lost, O’Connor says. In fact, when they only slightly moved the spleen as might occur in surgery, the previously smooth covering of mesothelial cells became lumpier and changed colors.</p><p>“We think this helps explain the cholinergic (acetylcholine) anti-inflammatory response that people have been studying for a long time,” O’Connor says.</p><p>Studies are currently underway at other institutions that, much like vagal nerve stimulation for seizures, electrically stimulate the vagal nerve to tamp down the immune response in people with rheumatoid arthritis. While there is no known direct connection between the vagal nerve and the spleen — and O’Connor and his team looked again for one — the treatment also attenuates inflammation and disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis, researchers at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research reported in 2016 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>O’Connor hopes drinking baking soda can one day produce similar results for people with autoimmune disease.</p><p>“You are not really turning anything off or on, you are just pushing it toward one side by giving an anti-inflammatory stimulus,” he says, in this case, away from harmful inflammation. “It’s potentially a really safe way to treat inflammatory disease.”</p><p>The spleen also got bigger with consuming baking soda, the scientists think because of the anti-inflammatory stimulus it produces. Infection also can increase spleen size and physicians often palpate the spleen when concerned about a big infection.</p><p>Other cells besides neurons are known to use the chemical communicator acetylcholine. Baking soda also interact with acidic ingredients like buttermilk and cocoa in cakes and other baked goods to help the batter expand and, along with heat from the oven, to rise. It can also help raise the pH in pools, is found in antacids and can help clean your teeth and tub.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>', 'A daily dose of baking soda may help reduce the destructive inflammation of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, scientists say.They have some of the first evidence of how the cheap, over-the-counter antacid can encourage our spleen to promote i', 'http://niroginepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Baking-soda-848x296.jpg', 'Science Daily', '2019-06-25 08:47:31', '2019-06-25 08:47:31'),

Hence, some people don’t call this &nbsp;a disease and rather call it as fibrocystic changes of the breast. The breast feels lumpy with indistinct nodular feeling of the whole breast. These are small fluid filled sacs that fluctuates with menstrual cycle. Sometimes one of these sacs attain bigger size and present as a breast cyst which again changes size with menstrual cycle. </span></li><li><span>Fibroadenoma is the most common lump found in female breast. It presents as rubbery to firm, smooth and well defined lump that easily slides under the skin. </span></li></ul></li><li><span>Infection: Infections can cause lump in the breast. Infection is common in breastfeeding women but can occur in non breastfeeding women. In breast feeding women it occurs 6-12 weeks after delivery but can occur at later stage. Continuing breastfeeding to recommended even if you develop mastitis or even if you are on antibiotics. If not controlled with antibiotics the infection turns into an abscess that needs to be surgically drained. </span></li><li><span>Malignant breast cancer: discussed elsewhere.</span></li><li><span>Injuries: Injury to fatty tissue in the breast can also cause a lump in the breast.</span></li><li><span>Others: </span><ul><li><span>Intraductal papilloma: These are small wart-like growths of gland, fibrous &nbsp;and blood vessels that develop in the milk duct.

It is non-cancerous growth.</span></li><li><span>Galactocele: harmless mild filled sac</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>Your doctor will obtain a medical history of your symptoms including a family history of any breast cancer. Your doctor will also perform a complete exam of your breast. If the breast exam is suggestive of fibrocystic changes, your doctor will ask you to come back after your menstrual period to repeat the breast exam. If the changes have resolved, you don’t need any further tests.If the changes persist you will need a mammogram or an ultrasound of the breast. Based on the results of ultrasound or mammogram you may need a biopsy of the lump to rule out a cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span> Breast lump caused by hormonal fluctuation do not need further treatment other than symptomatic treatment with painkillers. Vitamin E and evening primrose oil may alleviate pain associated with fibrocystic changes. Breast lump caused infection is treated with appropriate antibiotics. A breast abscess needs surgical drainage. Breast lump caused by cyst is treated by draining the fluid from the sac, Breast cancer is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek medical care?</code><p><span>A breast lump in premenopausal women can be monitored for a &nbsp;month or two to see if changes or resolves because of hormonal fluctuation with menstruation. </span><span>Immediate medical care should be sought if:</span></p><ul><li><span>The lump is hard and fixed to the breast tissue. </span></li><li><span>There is discharge from the nipple such as pus or blood. </span></li><li><span>Lump is associated with fever</span></li><li><span>You feel enlarged lymph nodes under your armpits.</span></li><li><span>There is inversion or retraction of the nipple. </span></li><li><span>You notices changes in the breast skin like dimpling, redness or crusting. </span></li></ul></div>'),

Most people who go to the emergency room with chest pain may have less serious problems, such as muscle pain, heartburn or anxiety, but we never know for sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Why does it matter?</code><p><span>It is very important that you take chest pain or tightness seriously. &nbsp;This is particularly more important if you are an adult who had heart attack in the past or is at risk of such attack. Heart attack causes severe chest pain because of ischemic injury to the heart muscles when blood supply is interrupted due to blockade of arteries of the heart. This is life threatening as this may lead to failure of the heart. Other simpler causes of chest pain may be the result of inflammation or injury in the chest or acidity or even psychological and needs to be differentiated properly with specific tests.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><em><b>Heart attack (Myocardial Infarction) or Angina:</b></em></p><p><span>Heart attack is the most important and life-threatening cause of chest pain resulting from sudden blockade of coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. Angina is the chest pain that results from narrowing of the coronary arteries, usually from deposition of plaques called atheroma in the walls of arteries. There are many risk factors for these problems, collectively known as coronary artery disease, most of which can be modified, while some cannot be. Modifiable risk factors include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Smoking</span></li><li><span>Diabetes mellitus</span></li><li><span>Hypertension</span></li><li><span>Obesity</span></li><li><span>Unhealthy dietary habit, mainly fatty diet</span></li><li><span>Inactive and stressful life style</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><b>Costrocondritis:</b></em><span> It is a common and severe but harmless cause of chest pain resulting from inflammation of joints between the cartilages and bones at the ribcage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><b>Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease:</b></em><span> It is a common condition related to the reflux of acidic gastric content that causes what is popularly called ‘heartbun’, a burning pain that begins over the stomach around the central part of lower chest and frequently confuses with heart attack. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><b>Anxiety:</b></em><span> It presents with fearful feeling, worry and tensed state of mind which commonly accompanies bodily symptoms such as chest pain. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><b>Pleurisy:</b></em><span> It is a condition resulting from inflammation of pleura that lines the lungs when there is pneumonia, lung collapse, blood clot in the lungs etc. Commonly there is pain in the part of chest overlying area of the lungs that is affected by infection, for example, during deep breathing or coughing. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><b>Other causes: </b></em><span>There may be many other causes of chest pain, some of them are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Problems in the heart other than heart attack, like infection around the heart</span></li><li><span>Problems affecting the lungs, like pneumonia or pneumothorax (air outside the lungs lining, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in vessels of the lungs)</span></li><li><span>Problems in the digestive tract like gastritis, peptic ulcers, or irritable bowel syndrome</span></li><li><span>Shingles (herpes zoster), a condition that occurs after chickenpox infection resulting in a painful rash</span></li><li><span>Any of injury to the chest, that includes surgery</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek help?</code><p><span>Any chest pain that is new, severe or persisting may mean serious disease like heart attack and you should seek medical help immediately. The following symptoms will help you to consider heart attack, especially if they last more than a few minutes or keep happening repeatedly.</span></p><ul><li><span>Sudden onset pain, tightness or discomfort in the center of the chest</span></li><li><span>Pain, or discomfort in the arms, neck, jaw or back</span></li><li><span>Chest pain gets worse when you walk, climb stairs, or do any physical activity</span></li><li><span>Shortness of breath and gasping for breath</span></li><li><span>Having cold, clammy skin or excessive sweating</span></li><li><span>An uneven or racing heart rate</span></li><li><span>Feeling lightheaded, dizzy or even fainting</span></li><li><span>Nausea, vomiting or heartburn</span></li><li><span>Anything that worries you, especially if you have had heart attack previously or you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment Options:</code><p><span>People often delay seeking medical help for a heart attack when they think that chest pain or tightness is not serious or vanish away on its own. Doing this may put you at risk of serious permanent damage to your heart and even cause death. </span></p><p><span>If you experience chest pain and especially if you have risk factors for heart attack, take a rest from whatever you are doing and visit the hospital as soon as possible. In the emergency room, you will get certain tests including ECG, Chest X ray and blood tests, to find out if you actually have problem with the heart. You will get Oxygen and medicine to reduce your pain and protect your heart further.</span></p><p><span>However, other causes of chest pain may not be so serious. In case of heart burn, medicine to neutralize and decrease secretion of acid will be given by your doctor and you should take timely meal, with a lot of water and no alcohol.

Excessive exercise, weight loss or weight gain, eating disorder can affect menstrual cycles.</li><li>Polycystic ovarian disease: As the name suggests, small fluid filled cysts form in the ovaries. The ovaries produce large amounts of male hormones and cause irregular menses or stop menstruating completely. In addition to menstrual irregularities, these women are obese and have excessive hair in the body (hirsutism).</li><li>Premature ovarian failure: In this case, a woman’s ovary fails to produce eggs before age 40 and menstrual cycle stops completely.

If you notice abnormalities in your menstrual cycle, you should keep a diary of cycle length, amount and duration of bleeding and other associated symptoms and bring it to the doctors visit. Your doctor will perform a physical and pelvic exam. You may need a pelvic ultrasound of the reproductive organs. Your doctor will decide if you need endometrial biopsy.

You can do brisk walking, jogging, dancing, gardening, or even just moving your arms while sitting.</li><li>The main thing is to burn the calories you have eaten with your activities. And you have to make sure that the extra activity is continued.</li><li>If you do dieting or exercise for a short period of time, you may lose weight but you will gain weight again if you go back to eating more and being inactive. So it is about changing your habit, if you want to lose weight steadily and remain healthy.</li><li>It is best to begin by making small changes and sticking with them.

It occurs in people who have strong personal or family history of allergy, asthma or hay fever. &nbsp;The rashes are distributed widely on the face, neck, trunks and limbs. Dry skin, overheating and detergents are known to make it worse. General control measures are avoiding irritants, avoid excessive use of soap, and regular use of moisturizers. Local steroid may be required,</span></p><p><b>Contact dermatitis:</b><span> This type of dermatitis occurs due to exposure to an allergen or an irritant.</span></p><ul><li><b> Irritant contact dermatitis</b><span> occurs mostly due to occupational or industrial exposure. People with dry skin or with atopic dermatitis have greater chance of developing irritant dermatitis. Skin lesions mostly occur in the hands and forearms. Skin can crack and have sore. Common causes are detergents, solvents, alkalis and cutting oils. </span></li><li><b>Allergic contact dermatitis</b><span> produces itchy rashes with swelling and sometimes blisters. Common agents are jewely (gold, nickel),cosmetics (hair dyes)and plants. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Most important part of managing allergic or irritant contact dermatitis is to avoid the contact with the allergen or irritant, and use of protective gloves and clothing where avoiding contact is not possible. Mild steroids help in recovery where the condition becomes worse. </span></li></ul><p><b>Drug Rash:</b><span> Drug rash can occur because of allergic reaction to the medicine or as a side effect. Any drug can cause rash, &nbsp;most common are antibiotics, steroids, painkillers, drugs used in epilepsy and drugs used to treat tuberculosis. Most drug rash resolve within days to weeks after the withdrawal of the drug. &nbsp;However, drug rash can be severe and life threatening. One should avoid taking such medicine in future.</span></p><p><b>Heat rash:</b><span> Also known as miliaria or sweat rash, &nbsp;occurs due to obstruction of sweat duct. It mostly occurs in hot, humid climates, tightly fitting clothing and overdressing. It appears as tiny, clear, red vesicles over the trunk, forehead, hands and legs that produce pricking sensation. Heat rash generally resolves by itself and is not considered a serious condition. Precautions to be taken are avoiding hot, humid places and avoiding wearing synthetic garments and tightly fitting clothes. Cotton clothes are best because these absorb sweat.</span></p><p><b>Intertrigo:</b><span> Skin rash caused by skin to skin friction. It usually occurs in warm, moist areas of the body like the groin, beneath the skin folds of the abdomen, under the breasts, armpits and between the toes. Due to repeated friction, the affected skin can crack resulting in pain and bleeding. Those with weak immune system (like diabetes, HIV) are at risk of bacterial and fungal infection. To avoid intertrigo, skin in area of contact should be kept clean and dry. Use of drying powder and wearing loose clothes helps to control moisture and friction in such areas. If infected, antibiotics or antifungals are needed.</span></p><p><b>Ringworm:</b><span> It is a fungal infection which appears as itchy, red, scaly, slightly raised and expanding rings on the body. &nbsp;Ringworm can be transmitted by skin to skin contact or by coming into contact with contaminated objects such as clothing or bedding. Characteristic feature of the ringworm infection is that the ring grows outward as the infection spreads and the central area becomes less infected. It can occur in different parts of the body and are named accordingly:</span></p><ul><li><span>Tinea corporis (trunk) </span></li><li><span>Tinea capitis (scalp) </span></li><li><span>Tinea faciei (face) </span></li><li><span>Tinea cruris (groin) </span></li><li><span>Tinea pedis (feet) </span></li><li><span>Tinea manuum (hand) and </span></li><li><span>Tinea unguium (nails). </span></li></ul><p><span>The infected area should be kept dry and synthetic clothing should be avoided. Antifungal creams, lotion, powder and shampoo are used to treat this condition. Ringworm of nails, scalp and complicated infections require &nbsp;oral antifungal drugs. &nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Shingles (Herpes Zoster):</b><span> It is caused by reactivation of chickenpox virus (Varicella zoster virus). When a person suffers from chickenpox, the virus remains inactive in the nerves. Due to weak immunity &nbsp;virus reactivates and gives rise to &nbsp;shingles. Symptoms include itching, pain and eruption of small grouped blisters on the specific areas of the body. The blisters break in few days leaving behind crusts. Shingles usually resolves within a few weeks. Painkillers can be used to relieve the pain. Antiviral drugs are used to in severe cases.</span></p><p><span>Shingles can affect eyes, which is serious condition and requires immediate care. </span></p><p><span>Sometimes it can lead to long term painful condition called Postherpetic neuralgia. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shingles can be prevented by vaccine. </span></p><p><span>This virus can also affect brain and spinal cord.</span></p><p><b>Bites and stings</b><span>: Insect bites (bed bugs, mosquito, spider sandfly) and &nbsp;stings (bees) can give rise to skin rashes. Sometimes it leads to serious allergic reactions which can be life threatening.</span></p><p><b>Psoriasis:</b><span> It is long term inflammation of the skin characterized by reddish, well demarcated lesions with silvery scales. Risk factors are: genetic, smoking, obesity, bacterial infections, drugs (example -anti malarial). Commonly involved regions include nails, elbows, knees, scalp and lower back. </span></p><p><span>Psoriasis can affect joints &nbsp;causing arthritis, and eyes . Steroids and ultraviolet light therapy are commonly used to treat this condition.</span></p><p><b>Rosacea:</b><span> It is long term skin inflammation characterized by redness and small red bumps. It mostly involves &nbsp;nose, cheeks, forehead and chin. Spicy foods, skin products, alcohol, stress, extreme temperature and sun exposure have been found to be associated with rosacea. </span></p><p><b>Lichen planus:</b><span> It usually appears as itchy, purplish, plane topped lesions mostly on the wrists and legs. Other areas which can be affected are face, hands, scalp, trunk, shin and genitals. The exact cause of Lichen planus is unknown. It can last for many months to a couple of years. The symptoms of itching and stinging can be controlled by applying cold compression.

Numbness is when one cannot feel any sensation in part of his/her body.', '<div><ul><p><span>Tingling and numbness are the loss of normal sensation in the various parts of body. Tingling is the prickling sensation also known as pins and needles and it is usually felt in hands and feet. Numbness is when one cannot feel any sensation in part of his/her body. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Why does it matter?</code><p><span>You will generally experience numbness or pins and needles when you are sitting crossed-legs because such awkward positions &nbsp; &nbsp;press your nerves or blood vessels that supply to those nerves. When you have some disease that traps or presses the nerves, you will feel numbness or tingling, as it is those nerves that carry such sensations to the brain. It can sometimes be a sign of some serious diseases like diabetes or problem of the spine. </span></p><p><span>Tingling is experienced as an unpleasant feeling in a specific area like that of pin pricks or shooting pain which can travel down from arm to leg or any one of them. You do not feel anything even if you are pricked with needle on the specific area where you feel the numbness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>There are various causes of tingling and numbness. Most common or important ones are discussed below:</span></p><ul><li><b> Trapped nerve:</b><span> Tingling and numbness can be caused by a trapped nerve due to back issues or prolapsed disc etc. The nerve gets trapped because of the pressure exerted on it hence causing pins and needles anywhere in the body, from head to toe, depending on where it is trapped. This may also impair the function of the part of body affected. There is a condition called carpel tunnel syndrome in which nerve trapping occurs at wrist resulting in the loss of grip as well as pain, tingling and numbness at affected hand.</span></li><li><b> Pressure:</b><span> If undue pressure is exerted on the nerves due to prolonged sitting on feet or wearing tight clothing, for example, it can cause tingling and numbness. This is usually reversible which means, if the pressure is relieved on time it gets better and has no serious consequences.</span></li><li><b> Injury:</b><span> Injury to a nerve can cause numbness and tingling in the part of body being supplied by the affected nerve. For example if nerve in neck is injured, numbness could be felt anywhere along the arm whereas back injury might cause the same in legs.</span></li><li><b> Diabetes</b><span>: When the blood sugar is not under control for several years, there can be damage in the small nerves beginning in the fingers and toes, hands and feet. This is called peripheral neuropathy. When you are unable to feel with your legs or hands, there is risk of injury from burn, prick, fall etc.</span></li><li><b> Medicines:</b><span> There are some medicines whose side effects are numbness or tingling resulting from the nerve damage. Such medicines include anticancer drugs, antiretroviral or antitubercular drugs, metronidazole, etc. </span></li><li><span><strong>Alcohol &amp; Tobacco:</strong> People who take a lot of alcohol or&nbsp;tobacco can develop serious conditions that cause tingling or numbness.</span></li><li><b> Vitamin Deficiency:</b><span> Strict vegetarians and people with disease called pernicious anemia have deficiency of Vitamin B 12 which can cause tingling and numbness, apart from anemia. </span></li><li><b> Diseases that damage nerves:</b><span> There are several diseases which affect the nervous system and cause tingling or numbness. Some of them are stroke, brain tumors and multiple sclerosis. Though they are relatively rare as cause of numbness or tingling, they are very serious conditions.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek&nbsp;medical care</code><ul><li><span>If you develop sudden weakness of limbs, loss of speech, unconsciousness or failure to control of your urine or stool, blurring of vision or blackout, etc., you should immediately see&nbsp;the doctor, preferably in the Emergency room. </span></li><li><span>If you have tingling or numbness following injury to head, neck or back or you get a sudden pain in the neck or back, it may be a serious condition that requires you to consult doctor immediately.</span></li><li><span>If you have tingling and numbness along with the manifestation of other diseases like diabetes, you should be alarmed and consult the doctor. </span></li><li><span>You should also seek medical attention if you have attacks of tingling and numbness times and again, without obvious cause or you are not recovering completely. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>The likely cause of numbness or tingling primarily determines whether or not you need specific treatment. The diagnosis of the cause also indicates&nbsp;which medicine, surgery or physical therapy to use for treatment. Some of the serious causes need immediate investigation and treatment through the emergency department while others&nbsp;are treated by regular outpatient follow up. You may be referred to specific specialists like neurologist or orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and definitive management.</span></p><p><span>However, there are certain things you may try yourself to reduce the symptoms of numbness and tingling. Those include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Loosen any tight shoes or clothing.</span></li><li><span>Avoid lifting of heavy weight, poor posture or repetitive movements in order to avoid neck or back problems.</span></li><li><span>Take regular breaks at work, do yoga and keep good posture all times.</span></li><li><span>Shake the limbs or move toes or get up if you are seating or leaning in the same position for a long time.</span></li><li><span>Avoid smoking and heavy alcohol consumption.</span></li><li><span>Stop medications causing numbness or tingling, if applicable.</span></li><li><span>Control your diabetes with proper diet, exercise, medicine and regular follow up.</span></li><li><span>If you have deficiency of Vitamin B 12, take dietary supplements upon consultation with your doctor.</span></li><li><span>Avoid certain risky activities like driving if you have bothersome numbness or tingling.</span></li><li><span>Regularly practice physiotherapy if your doctor has recommended it for your condition.</span></li></ul></ul></div>'),

The cause may be due to the following:<ul><li>Goiter from deficiency of Iodine or</li><li>Autoimmune inflammation of the gland or</li><li>Graves’s disease</li><li>Cancers of the thyroid gland.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Enlarged Salivary Glands</strong>:&nbsp;Parotid glands in the angles of jaw or submandibular glands under the jaw may be swollen due to infection or cancer.</li><li><strong>Benign Mass in the Neck</strong>:&nbsp;There may be a lump of fatty tissue called lipoma, cystic masses like sebaceous cyst, branchial cyst, cystic hygroma etc which usually do not cause much problems but can get infected causing swelling and pain. Injury or torticollis may lead to lumps in the muscles of the neck.</li><li><strong>Enlarged Lymph Nodes:</strong><ul><li><strong>Common Infections</strong>:&nbsp;When the lymph node swelling is a result of response to acute infection by bacteria or virus, it is generally painful, red and hot and it is called reactive lymphadenitis. If pus is formed in them, drainage of the pus would be needed; otherwise such lymph node swelling will resolve after some time, with or without treatment.<ul><li>Viral rashes like Measles, Rubella, Mononucleosis</li><li>Sore-throat which may be streptococcal or viral</li><li>Skin or wound infections, such as cellulites or erysipelas</li><li>Ear infections</li><li>Tuberculosis</li><li>Infected gums or abscess in root of tooth</li><li>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) —causing AIDS</li></ul></li><li><strong>Uncommon Infections</strong>:<ul><li>Cat scratch fever — an infection acquitted from a scratch or bite of cat</li><li>Syphilis – an infection which is sexually transmitted</li><li>Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cancer</strong>:&nbsp;When the neck swelling results from swollen lymph nodes is the result of drainage of cancer cells, it is more ominous sign, as it suggests spread of cancer from the tissue of its origin. The size of the swollen lymph nodes may vary from the size of a pea or kidney bean to larger ones. These lymph nodes are usually firm to hard.<ul><li>Leukemia — blood cancer</li><li>Lymphoma — cancer beginning from lymphatic tissues</li><li>Cancers of head, neck and upper GI tract or any other cancers in the body when it is widespread.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Disorders of the Immune System</strong>:<ul><li>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) — a chronic inflammatory disease affecting your skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs and blood cells</li><li>Rheumatoid arthritis — a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the synovium (the tissue lining the joints)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Certain medications like Phenytoin (used in seizure disorder) can also produce enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to Seek Help?</code><p>When you are concerned about your neck swelling or your swollen lymph nodes have following features, you need to see the doctor.</p><ul><li>The lymph nodes have appeared without any apparent reason</li><li>The neck lumps have been present for two to four weeks</li><li>The lymph nodes feel hard or rubbery, or they do not move when pushed</li><li>The neck swelling continues to enlarge</li><li>The neck swelling is accompanied by unexplained weight loss, night sweats or persistent fever</li><li>The neck swelling is associated with a sore throat or difficulty breathing or swallowing</li><li>Complications of infected swollen lymph nodes: Abscess formation, Sepsis(bloodstream infection), Cellulitis (a skin infection), Fistulas&nbsp;(seen in lymph nodes resulting from tuberculosis) etc.</li></ul><code>&nbsp;</code><code>Treatment Options</code><p>Swollen lymph nodes caused by viral infection resolve after the resolution of infection. Antibiotics are not used to treat viral infections. Treatment for neck swelling from other causes is based on the cause, as identified after investigations:</p><p><strong>Infection:</strong>&nbsp;Your doctor should prescribe appropriate antibiotics for the swollen lymph nodes caused by bacterial infections. If HIV infection is the cause of swollen lymph nodes, you will be given antiretroviral therapy. Surgery to drain pus may be needed if abscess has formed.</p><p><strong>Cancer:</strong>&nbsp;You will need treatment for the cancer if it is causing the neck swelling. Depending on the type of cancer, you may receive one or more of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.</p><p>If your swollen lymph nodes are painful, you may need some relief by applying a warm, wet compress to the affected area, taking over-the-counter painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol and adequate rest.</p></ul></div>'),
